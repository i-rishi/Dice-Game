It is a basic javaScript Project/Program using basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is a type of game where one player wins with the help of outcome of dice, the dice which give greater number the player associated with that will win. I used a Math.random function to generate random numbers for both players and then compared it with using if-else statments and changed the content using javaScript.
